# cdda-caliber-in-weapon-names

This mod adds the gun caliber to gun names. For example "Calico M960" is renamed into "Calico M960 (9mm)".

This makes it easier to identify suitable weapons and to manage a crate full of weapons.

Note that many weapons can use multiple different ammo types. The name will only include one.
